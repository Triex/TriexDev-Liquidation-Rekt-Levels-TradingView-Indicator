[Direct TradingView Script Link](https://www.tradingview.com/script/qI6EuJjG-TriexDev-Liquidation-Rekt-Levels/)

A basic indicator which lets you see where positions will be liquidated. Each line is based on default leverage levels typically used for trading. (3x,5x,10x,25x,50x)

In the settings:
- There is an offset to adjust the levels horizontally, this is to help make it easier to track if the chart has hit prior liquidation positions.
- You can change colours/opacity of the lines. 
- In the 'Style' tab you can hide individual levels.

_Inspired/initially based off 'Mex Rekt Level'_

## Future Updates
- [ ] Potential custom leverage 'x' level tracking, or additional levels on request.
