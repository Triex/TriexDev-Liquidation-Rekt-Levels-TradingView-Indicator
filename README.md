A basic indicator which lets you see where positions will be liquidated. Each line is based on default leverage levels typically used for trading. (3x,5x,10x,25x,50x)

In the settings:
- There is an offset to adjust the levels horizontally, this is to help make it easier to track if the chart has hit liquidation positions.
- You can change colours/opacity of the lines.
- You can hide the 'Labels', and/or 'label prompt'
- In the 'Style' tab you can hide individual levels.

_Inspired/initially based off 'Mex Rekt Level'_

I have this added to my charts, and toggle visibility when I want to check the liq levels.

Worth noting; the Market Makers often like to move to the longer-timeframe liquidation points when doing a big movement (to wreck as many traders/make as much money as possible), and are prone to flip it in the opposite direction after that. 
(Why I personally use liquidation points as a key indicator at times)
