# TriexDev - Liquidation Rekt Levels TradingView Indicator

[![Chart Snapshot](https://www.tradingview.com/x/D44FB7NQ)](https://www.tradingview.com/x/D44FB7NQ)

A basic indicator which lets you see where positions will be liquidated. Each line is based on default leverage levels typically used for trading. (3x,5x,10x,25x,50x)

In the settings there is an offset to adjust the levels horizontally, this is to help make it easier to track if the chart has hit prior liquidation positions.

_Inspired/initially based off 'Mex Rekt Level'_

## Future Updates
- [ ] Look at adding toggles for each level efficiently
- [ ] Potential custom leverage 'x' level tracking, or additional levels on request.
